## Standard operating procedures for citizen science experiments using the tricot approach
> Almendra Cremaschi, Marie-Angélique Laporte, Kauê de Sousa


# Tricot Protocols

This repository provides **standard operating procedures (SOPs)**, survey tools, and trait metadata for implementing **tricot** (Triadic Comparison of Technologies) on-farm trials. It is designed to support data collection, analysis, and reuse in a **FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and multilingual way.

## What is tricot?

Tricot is a participatory research approach where farmers test and compare three crop varieties (or technologies) on their own farms. It supports decentralized experimentation and citizen science while generating valuable data for breeding programs and food system actors. More at [https://climmob.net](https://climmob.net)
